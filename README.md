How to use it (practical dipole sizing)

Set Freq (MHz) to your target

Keep Length (×λ) = 0.50 for a standard half-wave dipole

Use VF ~ 0.95 as a starting point

Cut slightly long, then trim to resonance (real-world end effects + nearby objects)

Example (fast mental check):

At 100 MHz, λ ≈ 3.0 m → half-wave ≈ 1.5 m

With VF 0.95 → total ≈ 1.425 m → each arm ≈ 0.712 m
